    "This final examination is similar in scale to the midterm from several weeks ago, but covers the scope of the entire semester.  The final also attempts to create a real-world scenario that you might encounter as a data scientist is the field.  Our goal with this final is to compile the data required to be able to understand any possible relationship between population, population density, and the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus.  As in may real world cases, all of the data you need to do this analysis is not in one place, nicely formatted and compiled for you.  Through the final, you'll collect data from multiple sources and build your analytic dataset in a process that is documented, automated, and reproducable.\n",
