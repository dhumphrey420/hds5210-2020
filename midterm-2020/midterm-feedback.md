# Midterm Feedback

## Overall Score: 
49 / 50

This was well done.  The work at the end, putting the patient scores together was a little bit clunky with val=1 and length=335.  You could have just looped through the list using a for loop or at least calculated len(temp).


## Part 1: Creating a JSON Rules File
Comments - Nice work.

## Part 2: Functions to evaluate rules
Comments - Nice work.  I like the generic rule to evaluate range-based scores.  I'm not sure why you created the PaO2 and A-a Gradient functions, though.  No points off, but I think it was extra work.  Maybe my instructions made it sound like it was necessary.

## Part 3: Put it all together
Comments - Nice and simple.  Great!


## Part 4: Accessing and processing the patient file
Comments - Nice work putting this together, but you didn't follow-through to do the comparison of your scores and the provided scores. (-1)
